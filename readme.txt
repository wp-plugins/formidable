Quickly and easily build forms with a simple drag-and-drop interface and in-place editing.

== Description ==
Quickly and easily build forms with a simple drag-and-drop interface and in-place editing.
There are dozens of form-building plugins out there to create forms, but most are confusing and overly complicated. With Formidable, it is easy to create forms within a simple drag-and-drop interface. You can construct custom forms or generate them from a template. Shortcodes can be used as well as spam catching services.

= Features =
* Saves all responses to the database (even in the free version) for future retrieval, reports, and display in [Formidable Pro](http://formidablepro.com/ "Formidable Pro") Learn more at: http://formidablepro.com
* Integrates with reCAPTCHA and Akismet for Spam control
* Shortcode [formidable id=x] for use in pages, posts, or text widgets for WordPress version 2.8 and above.
* Alternatively use `<?php echo FrmEntriesController::show_form(2, $key = '', $title=true, $description=true); ?>` in your template
* Customize most HTML when editing the form
* Create forms from existing templates or add your own. A contact form template is included.

* Select an email address to send form responses on the form settings page under the "Emails" tab.
* Input default values into form fields with the option to clear when clicked

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu
3. Go to the Formidable 'Settings' menu to select a front-end preview page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q. Why aren't I getting any emails? =

A. Try the following steps:

   1. Double check to make sure your email address is present and correct in the "Emails" tab on the form "Settings" page
   2. Make sure you are receiving other emails from your site (ie comment notifications, forgot password...)
   3. Check your SPAM box
   4. Try a different email address.
   5. Install WP Mail SMPT or another similar plugin and configure the SMTP settings
   6. If none of these steps fix the problem, let us know and we'll try to help you find the bottleneck.

= Q. How do I edit the field name? =

A. The field and form names and descriptions are all changed with in-place edit. Just click on the text you would like to change, and it will turn into a text field.

= Q. Why isn't the form builder page working after I updated? =

A. Try clearing your browser cache. As plugin modifications are made, frequent javascript and stylesheet changes are also made. However, the previous versions may be cached so you aren't using the modified files. After clearing your cache and you're still having issues, please let us know.
